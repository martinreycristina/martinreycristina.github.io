00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.220
Feel buried alive

2
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.290
This city is uptight, suffocating and lonely in the crowd.

3
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm surrounded by all the screens of their life, screaming into space to drown

4
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
them out. I felt out so low felt nowhere to go.

5
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.670
But I know you wait for me.

6
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.120
You wait for me so far out of sight straight into the white.

7
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.550
But I know you wait for me.

8
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.290
I'm coming home.

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110
I'm coming back down tonight.

10
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.170
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights. 
But I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

11
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:05.020
Yeah, it's taken time to realize, but I'm coming home, 
I'm coming back  down tonight, so hold

12
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.700
me tight. I just want to fade out somewhere

13
00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.950
we can shipped the world away.

14
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.850
I'm ready to hide far from the fool out, they won't find us in the paradise we'll make.

15
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:29.550
I felt out so low felt nowhere to go, but I know you wait for me you wait

16
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.650
for me so far out of sight and into the white.

17
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.140
But I know you waiting for me.

18
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.850
I'm coming home.

19
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.610
I'm coming back down tonight.

20
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.750
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights. 
But I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

21
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:57.520
Yeah, it's taken time to realize,
but I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

22
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.650
I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

23
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.250
I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

24
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.920
Free falling from the high
I'm following the voice I know
Free falling from the high

25
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.350
I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

26
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.530
'Cause I've been hypnotized by the lights. 

27
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.070
But I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

28
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.850
Yeah, it's taken time to realize. 
But I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

29
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.360
I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.

30
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.560
I'm coming home, I'm coming back down tonight.
